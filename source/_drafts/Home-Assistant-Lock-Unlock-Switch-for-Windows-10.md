To make this work, we'll need to combine [IOT Link Windows 10 Lock Monitor](/IOT-Link-Windows-10-Lock-Monitor) (to detect if the machine is locked) with [particle_photon_pc_keyboard](https://github.com/nathanmfast/particle_photon_pc_keyboard) (for unlocking the machine via an MQTT-enabled USB keyboard).
